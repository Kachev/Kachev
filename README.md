# Welcome to my GitHub page! 👋🏼

- I am Hristo Kachev,  26 years old from Bulgaria. 
 In, 2015 I successfully completed my high school diploma and professional qualification as a mechanic for computer systems.
 After, that I worked as a car mechanic for a year and in, 2016 I moved to Germany. 
 Since the beginning of 2017 I have been working as a gardener in a garden and landscape construction company.
 From September 2021 to July 2022 I studied computer science, but unfortunately I had to drop out for financial reasons.
 Since I am very interested in programming and developing myself further, I registered with Neue Fische for a Web Developer Bootcamp.
